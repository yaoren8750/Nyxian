 @class FDMapObject
 @abstract A wrapper for managing a process's file descriptor map.
 @discussion
    FDMapObject provides an Objective-C interface for copying,
    applying, and manipulating the file descriptor table of a process.
    It is designed to be passed across XPC boundaries and supports
    NSSecureCoding for safe serialization.
